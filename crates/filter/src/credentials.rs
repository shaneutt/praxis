//! Authority-bound deferred credentials for outbound sub-requests.
//!
//! A chain-binding filter (for example an AI callout) frequently must attach a
//! secret — an API key, a bearer token — to the outbound sub-request it drives.
//! Injecting that secret into the sub-request headers before the destination is
//! resolved would leak it to whatever authority the outbound chain happens to
//! select, turning a routing mistake or SSRF into credential exfiltration.
//!
//! [`DeferredCredential`] closes that gap: the caller binds each secret to the
//! authority (`host` or `host:port`) permitted to receive it and stages the set
//! as [`PendingCredentials`] in the request extensions projected into the child
//! context. The sub-request executor materializes a credential *only after* it
//! has resolved and validated the destination, and *only* into a request bound
//! for the matching authority. Credentials whose authority does not match the
//! resolved destination are dropped, their secrets zeroized, and never sent.
