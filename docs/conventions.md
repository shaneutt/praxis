# Development Conventions

## Coding Style

### General Principles

- Brevity is a component of quality. Keep code lean and
  complete; no bloat.
- Small, composable, single-purpose functions are the
  default unit of organization. Split code into small
  files with focused responsibilities.
- Minimize side effects. Prefer pure transformations when
  feasible: data in, data out. Resist mutable state when
  feasible and outside the critical paths.
- Keep functions short enough to reason about in isolation.

### Important Tools

- **Clippy**: Enforce idiomatic Rust and catch common mistakes
- **rustfmt**: Ensure consistent code formatting
- **cargo-audit**: Check for vulnerable dependencies
- **cargo-deny**: Enforce supply chain safety policies
- **rustdoc**: Generate the API documentation
- **cargo xtask**: Developer task runner for benchmarks, flamegraphs, and debug utilities
- **benchmarks**: Criterion microbenchmarks and scenario-based load tests ([Fortio], [Vegeta])

### Comments vs Tracing

Prefer `tracing::info!`, `tracing::debug!`, or
`tracing::trace!` over inline comments for describing
runtime behavior. Comments that say what the code is doing
at runtime ("parse the config", "reject the request",
"skip this filter") should be tracing calls instead.

Use comments only when explaining compile-time or
structural rationale (the "why", not the "what"), or when
the context is too long for a tracing message.

### Testing

**New capabilities require all of the following:**

1. Unit tests covering the implementation
2. Integration tests proving end-to-end behavior
3. An example config in `examples/configs/`
4. A configuration test validating that the example
   parses correctly (covered by
   `all_example_configs_parse` for YAML examples)
5. Significant changes need to be [benchmarked].

This is not optional. A feature without tests and an
example is not complete.

Prefer more doctests when in doubt. Duplicative coverage
between doctests and unit/integration tests is fine.

Prefer assertion messages over inline comments. Put the
explanation in the assertion's message argument so it
prints on failure:

```rust
// Bad:
// ACL should block loopback
assert_eq!(status, 403);

// Good:
assert_eq!(status, 403, "ACL should block loopback");
```

### RFC Conformance

When implementing protocol-level behavior (HTTP semantics,
header handling, TLS, etc.), identify the governing RFCs
and verify conformance against them.

- Cite the specific RFC number and section in test names
  or doc comments for protocol conformance tests.
- When in doubt about an edge case, the RFC is the
  authority, not other proxy implementations.
- Add dedicated conformance tests when implementing
  RFC-specified behavior. These live in
  `tests/conformance/`.

### Rules, Practices & Lints

Security is enforced at the lint level. See lints in
[Cargo.toml] for the full set.

- `#![deny(unsafe_code)]` in all crate roots (no
  exceptions; unsafe belongs upstream)
- Clippy runs with `-D warnings` (zero tolerance)
- Errors via `thiserror`
- Logging via `tracing`
- Use workspace dependencies (`[workspace.dependencies]`)
  to keep versions consistent across crates
- Keep dependencies light. Avoid new dependencies
  when feasible
- Only add dependencies with well-established
  reputation
- `cargo audit` and `cargo deny check` enforce supply
  chain safety (see [development.md])

#### Additional Coding Conventions

- Use separator comments to visually separate distinct
  sections of code.
- **No re-export-only files.** If a file exists solely
  to `pub use` items from another crate or module,
  inline the import at the call site instead.
- **Constants** must be at the top of the file (after
  imports), never inside functions or impl blocks.
  Give them their own separator comment
  (e.g. `// Constants`).
- **File ordering**:
  1. Constants (with separator comment)
  2. Public types, impls, and functions
  3. Private types and impls (below their public
     consumers)
  4. Private utility/helper functions (with separator)
  5. `#[cfg(test)] mod tests` block (always last)
- **Field and method ordering**: Alphabetical, with
  `name` pinned first on structs and `new()`/`name()`
  pinned first in impl blocks.
- **Inside `#[cfg(test)] mod tests`**:
  1. Imports
  2. All test functions (`#[test]` / `#[tokio::test]`)
  3. Test utilities at the end (with `// Test Utilities`
     separator)
- Place a blank line between attribute blocks.
- Separate distinct logical actions with blank lines. Function
  calls, variable bindings that begin a new step, and expression
  blocks that perform a discrete operation should have some newline space.
- Prefer pre-computed numeric literals over expressions
  like `1024 * 10`. Always add a trailing comment with
  the human-readable size or meaning (e.g.
  `const MAX_BODY: usize = 10_485_760; // 10 MiB`).

## Code Responsibility

This project does not distinguish between code written by
hand, generated by a tool (e.g. lint), or produced by any
other means. **Every contributor is responsible for the
code they submit**, and *all* code MUST be human reviewed
before submission, or merging.

Signed-off commits (`Signed-off-by:`) are required and
represent your assertion that you have reviewed and fully
understand the changes you are submitting.

PRs from a bot or tool (with the exception of GitHub-specific
ones like `dependabot`) will not be accepted.

Before submitting or merging PRs, ensure that you have:

- Read every line of the diff. If you cannot explain why something exists, do not submit it.
- Verified that the change does what you intended and nothing more.
- Run the test suite *locally* first. The CI pipeline is not a substitute for local verification.

> **Note**: `Draft` pull requests are not exempt from these guidelines.
> They are still expected to be reviewed before submission.
