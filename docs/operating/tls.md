## Listener TLS

Add `tls` to any listener. PEM format; the cert file
may include the full chain. See [tls-termination] for
a complete example.

```yaml
tls:
  certificates:
    - cert_path: /etc/praxis/tls/cert.pem
      key_path: /etc/praxis/tls/key.pem
```

### SNI and Multiple Certificates

Multiple certificates on a single listener enable
SNI-based selection. Entries with `server_names` match
those hostnames; wildcard entries like `*.example.com`
match single-level subdomains. Mark exactly one entry with
`default: true` to serve as the fallback for unmatched
SNI. An entry without `server_names` that is not marked
`default: true` is rejected as ambiguous. If no entry
has `default: true`, unmatched SNI is rejected (no
fallback). See [tls-multi-cert].

### Certificate Hot-Reload

Certificate hot-reload is enabled by default. Cert and
key files are watched for changes. When modified (e.g. by
certbot, cert-manager, or Vault PKI), the proxy atomically
picks up the new certificate within 500ms. Existing
connections are unaffected; only new TLS handshakes use the
rotated certificate.

To explicitly disable hot-reload, set `hot_reload: false`.
Multi-cert SNI configs auto-disable hot-reload.

Hot-reload is compiled in by the `config-reload` build
feature (on by default); a binary built without it serves
the certificate statically. See
[Build Features](build-features.md).

**Constraints:**

- Hot-reload applies only to single-cert listeners.
  Multi-cert SNI configs are automatically excluded.
- If the new certificate fails to parse, the proxy logs
  a warning and continues serving the previous valid
  certificate. Consecutive failures trigger exponential
  backoff (up to 60s) to avoid log spam.
- A client-CA reload updates verification only. The CA
  names advertised to clients in the TLS
  `CertificateRequest` are captured at startup and are
  never updated, so rotating to a client CA with a
  different subject leaves clients that select their
  certificate from that list pointing at the retired CA
  until the proxy restarts. Rotate through a `client_ca`
  bundle holding both the outgoing and incoming CA to
  avoid the gap.

**Debounce behavior:** filesystem events are debounced by
500ms to handle atomic rename patterns used by Kubernetes
secret mounts, certbot, and cert-manager. A cert-manager
rotation that writes a temp file and then renames it over
the original triggers a single reload after the rename
completes.

**Alternative: graceful restart.** Pingora supports
graceful restart via SIGHUP with FD passing. This reloads
all configuration including certificates, but drains
in-flight connections. Use graceful restart when
hot-reload is not needed or for config changes beyond
certificate rotation.

### Minimum TLS Version

`min_version` restricts the minimum protocol version:
`tls12` (default) or `tls13`. See
[tls-version-constraint].

### Listener mTLS

Require or request client certificates with
`client_ca` and `client_cert_mode`.

| Mode | Behavior |
| ---- | -------- |
| `none` | Do not request a client certificate (default) |
| `request` | Ask for a cert but allow connections without one |
| `require` | Reject connections without a valid client cert |

`client_ca` is required when mode is `request` or
`require`. See [tls-mtls-listener] and
[tls-mtls-listener-request].

### Certificate Revocation Lists (CRL)

Add `crl_paths` to `client_ca` to reject client
certificates that appear on a Certificate Revocation
List. Each path must point to a PEM-encoded CRL file.
Paths containing `..` are rejected at validation to
prevent directory traversal.

```yaml
tls:
  client_cert_mode: require
  client_ca:
    ca_path: /etc/praxis/tls/client-ca.pem
    crl_paths:
      - /etc/praxis/tls/client-ca.crl
  certificates:
    - cert_path: /etc/praxis/tls/cert.pem
      key_path: /etc/praxis/tls/key.pem
```

CRL checking applies only to listener client
authentication. Upstream (cluster) CRL checking is
not implemented, so `tls.ca.crl_paths` on a cluster
definition is rejected at config validation rather
than silently ignored.

### Local dev with mkcert

```console
mkcert -install
mkcert localhost 127.0.0.1
```

Point `cert_path` and `key_path` at the generated files.

## Cluster TLS

Add `tls:` to a cluster to TLS-connect to endpoints.
`sni` sets the backend SNI hostname. `verify` controls
certificate verification (default: `true`). See
[upstream-tls] and [tls-verify-disabled].

### Upstream mTLS (Client Certificate)

Present a client certificate to upstream servers.
See [tls-mtls-upstream] and [tls-mtls-both].

The certificate and key are read and checked at
startup: the certificate must parse as X.509 and the
key must match it, so a mismatched or corrupt pair
fails config load instead of every upstream handshake.

## CA Trust

Three levels of CA trust, evaluated in order:

1. **Per-cluster CA** (`tls.ca.ca_path`): applies to
   one cluster only.
2. **Global CA** (`runtime.upstream_ca_file`): applies
   to all clusters without their own `tls.ca`.
3. **System trust store**: used when neither of the
   above is set.

The global CA **replaces** the system trust store (not
additive). If backends use both a private CA and
public CAs, create a combined PEM bundle. See
[upstream-ca-file].

## Timeouts

Pingora enforces a 60-second TLS handshake timeout
(hardcoded). For total connection budgets (TCP + TLS),
use `total_connection_timeout_ms` on the cluster. See
[configuration.md](configuration.md) for details.

## Certificate and Key Security

Private keys should have restrictive file permissions.
Praxis warns at startup if keys are group or world
readable.

```console
chmod 600 /etc/praxis/tls/key.pem
chown praxis:praxis /etc/praxis/tls/key.pem
```

Don't store private keys in version control or
unencrypted on disk. Use a secrets manager or
encrypted storage solution.

## Cipher Suites

Praxis uses rustls, which supports TLS 1.2 and 1.3
only. No weak cipher suites are available.

By default, rustls selects cipher suites automatically.
To restrict the set, specify `cipher_suites` on the
listener TLS block. When set, only the listed suites
are offered during the TLS handshake. An empty list is
rejected at validation.

### Available Suites

**TLS 1.3:**

| Config value | Suite |
| ------------ | ----- |
| `tls13_aes_128_gcm_sha256` | AES-128-GCM with SHA-256 |
| `tls13_aes_256_gcm_sha384` | AES-256-GCM with SHA-384 |
| `tls13_chacha20_poly1305_sha256` | ChaCha20-Poly1305 with SHA-256 |

**TLS 1.2:**

| Config value | Suite |
| ------------ | ----- |
| `tls12_ecdhe_ecdsa_with_aes_128_gcm_sha256` | ECDHE-ECDSA AES-128-GCM |
| `tls12_ecdhe_ecdsa_with_aes_256_gcm_sha384` | ECDHE-ECDSA AES-256-GCM |
| `tls12_ecdhe_ecdsa_with_chacha20_poly1305_sha256` | ECDHE-ECDSA ChaCha20-Poly1305 |
| `tls12_ecdhe_rsa_with_aes_128_gcm_sha256` | ECDHE-RSA AES-128-GCM |
| `tls12_ecdhe_rsa_with_aes_256_gcm_sha384` | ECDHE-RSA AES-256-GCM |
| `tls12_ecdhe_rsa_with_chacha20_poly1305_sha256` | ECDHE-RSA ChaCha20-Poly1305 |

TLS 1.2 suites cannot be used when `min_version` is
`tls13`. See [tls-cipher-suites].

```yaml
tls:
  cipher_suites:
    - tls13_aes_256_gcm_sha384
    - tls13_chacha20_poly1305_sha256
  certificates:
    - cert_path: /etc/praxis/tls/cert.pem
      key_path: /etc/praxis/tls/key.pem
```
