# Examples

Configuration examples organized by category.

## Running an Example

```console
cargo run -p praxis-proxy -- -c examples/configs/traffic-management/basic-reverse-proxy.yaml
curl http://localhost:8080/
```

Configs use local ports (`3000`, `3001`, ...) for
upstreams. For quick experiments without a real backend,
use `static_response` (see
[static-response.yaml](configs/traffic-management/static-response.yaml))
or run Praxis with no config file for a built-in welcome
page.
